# python-practice
Python implementations of various algorithmic problems with example usages or tests.
Others will follow! :)

## Usage
First, run the `setup.py'` for installing the dependencies:
```
> python setup.py install
```

After this, you are set to run examples/tests:
```
> python DataStructures/HashTable.py
```

## Available implementations
List of available implementations by categories. The ones marked with a [t] have test cases available.

### Data structures
* ArrayList [t]
* Graph
* Queue
* Trie
* BinaryHeap [t]
* HashTable [t]
*  Stack

### Sorting
* Mergesort [t]
* Quicksort [t]

### Searching
* BFS [t]
* DFS [t]
* BinarySearch [t]

### Others
* Find all integers, where a^3 + b^3 == c^3 + d^3 between 1 and 1000
* Remove duplicates from list
* Find recursively all combination of elements
* Given 2 strings,  S1 and S2, sort S1 in same order as S2
